## About realisation
The game is made using npm web sockets library(ws). In the progress of development, i used methods of asyncronous programming such as callbacks and promises. Also i made movement smoothing on client. It means client tries to smooth and foresee movement of objects. Thanks to that we can save a lot of internet traffic, because sockets send rate is lover. Also it helps to deal with time delays, so user almost will not see them.

> You can find server script in /src

> You can find client script in /static.

> To launch server, launch index.js. You can connect to server using browser through server's address and port.
